# Game on memorizing the sequence of appearing balls

Execute main.py file, enter the numbers of balls to start the game and watch closely to try to memorize the sequence. Click on appeared white balls with "?" marks on them and the mark will be changed with number of sequence. If you're sure that all numbers are correct press Enter. If you memorized right, the message will pop up that you've won and you can continue with one ball added in next level, otherwise you'll be asked to play again or quit. 
While playing, if you click on the ball twice, its number will change on "?" again.
